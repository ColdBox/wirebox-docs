# ID-Model-Empty Namespace

The default namespace is not specifying one. This namespace is used to retreive either named mappings or full component paths.

| DSL | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| empty | Same as saying id. Get a mapped instance with the same name as defined in the property, argument or setter method. |
| id | Get a mapped instance with the same name as defined in the property, argument or setter method. |
| id:{name} | Get a mapped instance by using the second part of the DSL as the mapping name. |
| id:{name}:{method} | Get the {name} instance object, call the {method} and inject the results |
| model | Get a mapped instance with the same name as defined in the property, argument or setter method. |
| model:{name} | Get a mapped instance by using the second part of the DSL as the mapping name. |
| model:{name}:{method} | Get the {name} instance object, call the {method} and inject the results |

```javascript
// Let's assume we have mapped a few objects called: UserService, SecurityService and RoleService

// Empty inject, use the property name, argument name or setter name
property name="userService" inject;

// Using the name of the mapping as the value of the inject
property name="security" inject="SecurityService";

// Using the full namespace
property name="userService" inject="id:UserService";
property name="userService" inject="model:UserService";

// Simple factory method
property name="roles" inject="id:RoleService:getRoles";
```
